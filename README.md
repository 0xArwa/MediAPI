#  MediAPI


## Overview
This repository contains an old API. Although it is no longer actively maintained, I wanted to share it as a demonstration of my past work.

The API is built using the following technologies:
- `Node.js`
- `Express`
- `Sequelize`

Please note that Flask imp. is not included in this repository, as it was developed in another project and linked using an end-point.
